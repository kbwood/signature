jQuery Signature
================

This plugin sets a div to allow capture of a signature and converts it to JSON or SVG for storage. Requires jQuery UI and ExCanvas (for IE).

Have a look at the plugin Web site, http://keith-wood.name/signature.html, for demonstrations of its abilities.

For documentation on the functionality see http://keith-wood.name/signatureRef.html.
